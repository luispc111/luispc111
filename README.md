### "Hello there"

My name is Luis Alberto, I am a computer science student at Tec de Monterrey. I am passionate about programming, sports and spreading good vibes. I'm still on the way to finding what I want to specialize in, so, I'm open to learning whatever gets in my way.

I've got two goals as a software engineer:
- To help solve real life problems.
- To make hard things, easy with technology. 

You can find me on twitter and instagram as *@luispc111*
